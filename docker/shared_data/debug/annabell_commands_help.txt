The training procedure can be simplified by using macros, which execute some standard sequences of
training commands.
All macros have the format:
command /cue/phrase/word group/
or
command /first cue & second cue/phrase/word group/
where command is one of the following commands:
.ph suggests a phrase to be retrieved by the association process;
.wg suggests a word group to be extracted from the working phrase;
.pg insert the working phrase and the current word group in the top of the goal stack;
.po sends the word group to output and produces a partial reward for the past state-action
sequence;
.o sends the word group to output and produces a (conclusive) reward for the past state-
action sequence;

cue is a word group that must be extracted from the current working phrase and used as a cue, phrase is
the phrase that must be retrieved from the long-term memory using cue, and word group is an optional
group of words extracted from phrase.
If phrase is omitted, the standard form of a phrase:
cue , word group
is retrieved from the long term memory. This form can be used to perform simple substitutions, e.g. to
translate the second person to the first person

let us count backwards
count back from three

command /cue/phrase/word group/
command = pg - insert the working phrase and the current word group in the top of the goal stack;
cue = count - cue is a word group that must be extracted from the current working phrase and used as a cue
word group = count -
.pg /count/let us count backwards/count/

==

.wg count
.ph let us count backwards
.wg count
.push_goal

what does it mean to have word or phrases in the goal stack?
